# Kerbonaut Redux

Hey! This is a KSP mod I made that lets you put cosmetics on your kerbals. (Hopefully even more in the future)

## What's This?

Ever wanted to give your kerbals cool hairstyles, hats, or other accessories? That's exactly what it does!

## Projects in this repo

- **KerbonautRedux-Mod** - The actual game mod (C#) - For adding cosmetics on kerbals
- **KerbonautRedux-CosmeticManager** - A tool to manage configs (Python)
- **CrewPortraitFix** - Tiny fix for the crew portrait camera (C#)

## Quick Start

1. Build the mod DLLs and drop them in your GameData folder
2. Use the Cosmetic Manager to set up your kerbals
